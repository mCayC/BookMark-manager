BookMark-manager

The purpose of this Windows Forms application is to help you save your bookmarks offline.

This project is currently on hiatus until I finished my higher priorities projects.

Current state of application:
+ Able to add bookmark to your main list.
- Save not yet implemented (plan to do this with JSON/XML file).
